# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

This project is a visualizer for various sorting algorithms built with React. It helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work by providing a visual representation of the sorting process. Users can select different sorting algorithms, adjust parameters such as the number of bars and the sorting speed, and view the sorting process in real-time. Additionally, a wave effect is applied to the bars once the sorting is complete to enhance the visual appeal.

## Features

-   Sorting Algorithms: Includes Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and Heap Sort.
-   Interactive Controls: Allows users to select sorting algorithms, adjust the number of bars, and control sorting speed.
-   Visual Feedback: Provides a visual representation of the sorting process with color changes to highlight active bars.
-   Randomization: The initial bar heights are randomized, and a wave effect is applied after sorting completes.
-   Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes and provides a smooth user experience.

## Sorting Algorithms

This project includes several sorting algorithms. Below is a brief overview of each algorithm, including its time complexity and a sample implementation.

### 1. Bubble Sort

**Description**: Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

**Time Complexity**:

-   Best Case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)
-   Average Case: O(n²)
-   Worst Case: O(n²)

### 2. Quick Sort

**Description**: Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot. The pivot is chosen so that elements less than the pivot come before it and elements greater come after it.

**Time Complexity**:

-   Best Case: O(n log n)
-   Average Case: O(n log n)
-   Worst Case: O(n²) (when the pivot is the smallest or largest element)

### 3. Merge Sort

**Description**: Description: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together. It is known for its efficiency and stability.

**Time Complexity**:

-   Best Case: O(n log n)
-   Average Case: O(n log n)
-   Worst Case: O(n log n)

### 4. Insertion Sort

**Description**: Description: Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as Quick Sort.

**Time Complexity**:

-   Best Case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)
-   Average Case: O(n²)
-   Worst Case: O(n²)

### 5. Heap Sort

**Description**: Description: Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It first builds a max heap from the input data and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and reconstructs the heap until the array is sorted.

**Time Complexity**:

-   Best Case: O(n log n)
-   Average Case: O(n log n)
-   Worst Case: O(n log n)

## Usage
